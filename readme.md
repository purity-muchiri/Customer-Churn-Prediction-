#  Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom

A data science project to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning. This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology.

---

##  Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major issue in the telecom industry. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling the company to take proactive retention measures.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn
- Provide actionable insights for business decisions

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CRISP-DM Framework
- Git/GitHub

---

##  CRISP-DM Process

### 1. Business Understanding
- Understand the problem of churn and its impact on revenue

### 2. Data Understanding
- Load and explore customer data

### 3. Data Preparation
- Clean missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features

### 4. Modeling
- Train and evaluate classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

### 5. Evaluation
- Use metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

### 6. Deployment
- Discuss possible deployment strategies (e.g., Streamlit app, dashboard)

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. It contains information on customer demographics, services signed up for, and whether or not the customer churned.

---

##  Results

- Model Accuracy: XX%
- F1 Score: XX
- Key features impacting churn: Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Tenure

---

##  Future Work

- Improve performance with hyperparameter tuning
- Try deep learning approaches
- Deploy model with Streamlit or Flask
